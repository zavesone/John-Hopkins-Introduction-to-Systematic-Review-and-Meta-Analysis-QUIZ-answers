Question 1
Which of the following is/are legitimate reason(s) to NOT do a meta-analysis?  (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

The studies included in the systematic review do not address the same fundamental research question.

Correct

The studies included in the systematic review are of different designs with varying methodological quality.

Correct

The outcome data needed for the meta-analysis are not available from 4 out of the 15 studies included in the systematic review.


None of these options


Question 2
What is the main advantage of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) over the Mean Difference (MD)? 

1 / 1 point

The MD is generally easier to interpret than the SMD.


The SMD is generally easier to interpret than the MD.


The SMD is preferable when the studies in a meta-analysis measure a given outcome using different scales or instruments.


The SMD is preferable when the studies in a meta-analysis measure more than one outcome.

Correct

Question 3
Which of the following is/are true about odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR)? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

1 / 1 point

The OR has better statistical properties, but, in general, is less intuitive to interpret than the RR.

Correct

The OR is more conservative than the RR, especially when the event is common.


Both the OR and the RR are valid measures of association/treatment effect.

Correct

The OR is a good estimate of the RR when the event is rare in both treatment and comparison groups.

Correct

Question 4
Which of the following is/are true about meta-analysis? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

1 / 1 point

A high quality meta-analysis gets rid of heterogeneity that might be observed across individual studies.


Meta-analysis provides a single estimate of an effect size (with an associated confidence interval) with information from all relevant individual studies.

Correct

The meta-analytic effect size usually has greater precision than individual study effect sizes.

Correct

Meta-analysis allows the statistical evaluation of homogeneity/heterogeneity of results.

Correct
