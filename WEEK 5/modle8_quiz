Question 1
Which of the following is TRUE about the random-effects model? 

1 / 1 point

The random effects model assumes that all studies in the meta-analysis share a common (“true”) effect.


The random effects model assumes that all observed variation reflects sampling (“random”) error.


The random-effects model is generally used when the variation in estimates among included studies is considered low.


The random-effects model assumes that the different studies in the meta-analysis are estimating different, but related, intervention effects sampled from a distribution of true effects.

Correct
2. Question 2
Which of the following is/are TRUE about the assignment of weights in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

1 / 1 point

The weight assigned to a study in a fixed-effect model equals to the inverse of variance of that study.

Correct

Information from larger studies and smaller studies are weighted equally.


Information from more precise studies is weighted more heavily than information from less precise studies.

Correct

In a fixed-effect model, weight assignment does not depend on study sample size.

3. Question 3
Which of the following is TRUE about the fixed-effect model?

1 / 1 point

The assumptions underlying the fixed-effects model are the same as those underlying the random-effects model.


The fixed-effect model assumes that all studies in the analysis share a common (“true”) effect.


The summary effect in the fixed-effect model is the estimate of the mean of all relevant true effects.


True effects in the studies are assumed to have been sampled from a distribution of true effects.

Correct
4. Question 4
Which of the following is/are assumed source(s) of variance in the random-effects model? 

A.	Within-studies variance (i.e., random error within studies)

B.	Between-studies variance (i.e., variance of the distribution of the true effects across studies)

1 / 1 point

A.


B.


Both A. and B.


Neither A. or B.

Correct
5. Question 5
Which of the following is TRUE about the Tau-squared estimate?

(SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

1 / 1 point

If the number of studies is large, then the estimate of Tau-squared will have poor precision.


Tau-squared is an estimate of the between-studies variance

Correct

Tau-squared is an estimate of the within-studies variance.


Tau-squared is the total of the estimates of the within-studies and between-studies variances.
